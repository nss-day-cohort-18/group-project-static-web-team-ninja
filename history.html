		<h2>Company History</h2>
		<h3>The Legend of Stuff Inc. began here...</h3>
		<p>
			Stuff Inc. was founded by Blaise Roberts in 1957 when he purchased the Stuff Inc. House motel adjacent to the Los Angeles International Airport. Over the following decade, Jay Roberts and his brother Donald Roberts, working together with other Roberts family business interests, grew the company into a North American management and hotel ownership company, which became a public company in 1962. In 1968, Stuff Inc. International was formed and subsequently became a separate public company. Stuff Inc. Corporation and Stuff Inc. International Corporation were taken private by the Roberts family business interests in 1979 and 1982, respectively. On December 31, 2004, substantially all of the hospitality assets owned by Roberts family business interests, including Stuff Inc. Corporation and Stuff Inc. International Corporation, were consolidated under a single entity, now named Stuff Inc. Hotels Corporation.

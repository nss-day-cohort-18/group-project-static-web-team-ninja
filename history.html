			<h2>Company History</h2>
			<h3>The Legend of Stuff Inc. began here...</h3>
				<p>
					Blaise Roberts was born into greatness.  Naturally, his greatness was bound to cascade into his entrepreneurial endeavors, which primarily focuses on the manufacturing and selling of Widgets.  Blaise founded Stuff Inc. in 2010.  He only had to wait two months for Stuff Inc. to grow into a monopoly.
				</p>
				<p>
					You cannot trust anyone these days, especially the other project groups in cohort-18.  For this reason, Blaise recruited his childhood friends Harry Epstein, Dara Thomas, and Talbot Lawrence to further augment his conglomeration. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Since 2015, Stuff Inc. has been the front runner in the Widgets market.  Everybody needs stuff, and everybody needs stuff in the form of a Widget, and what better company to sell you Widgets at a high cost than Stuff Inc.
